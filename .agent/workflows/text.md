description: Generate high-quality markdown text based on the prompt without any file operations. Useful for drafting content or prompts for Kamos.

1. **Generate Text**
   - Read the user's prompt: "${1}"
   - Generate a comprehensive, well-structured response in **Markdown** format.
   - **Constraint**: Do NOT use any tools (e.g., `write_to_file`, `run_command`). Do NOT save anything to disk.
   - **Goal**: Provide clean, copy-pasteable text that the user might want to use as input for Kamos or other purposes.
